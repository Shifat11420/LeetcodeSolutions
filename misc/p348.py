# Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an n x n board between two players:
# A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
# Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
# A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
# Implement the TicTacToe class:
# TicTacToe(int n) Initializes the object the size of the board n.
# int move(int row, int col, int player) Indicates that the player with id player plays at the cell (row, col) of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move, and the two players alternate in making moves. Return
# 0 if there is no winner after the move,
# 1 if player 1 is the winner after the move, or
# 2 if player 2 is the winner after the move.
 
# Example 1:
# Input
# ["TicTacToe", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move"]
# [[3], [0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 1]]
# Output
# [null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

# Explanation
# TicTacToe ticTacToe = new TicTacToe(3);
# Assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.
# ticTacToe.move(0, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
# |X| | |
# | | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
# | | | |

# ticTacToe.move(0, 2, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# | | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
# | | | |

# ticTacToe.move(2, 2, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# | | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
# | | |X|

# ticTacToe.move(1, 1, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# | |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
# | | |X|

# ticTacToe.move(2, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# | |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
# |X| |X|

# ticTacToe.move(1, 0, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
# |X| |O|
# |O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
# |X| |X|

# ticTacToe.move(2, 1, 1); // return 1 (player 1 wins)
# |X| |O|
# |O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
# |X|X|X|
